# RetroSnake
A clone of the classic arcade game Snake written in python with tkinter.

Control the snake with W,A,S,D keys.
Collect apples to increase your score.
Collect golden apples to increase your score by 5.
If you collide with the snake or the walls, it's game over.

Make sure you have python3, and pygame installed.
Although the game uses tkinter for drawing graphics, it uses pygame for sound effects and vectors.
